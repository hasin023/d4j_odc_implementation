## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Checking`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Design/Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The defect is a missing validation check (Checking) for the input parameter 'v' to ensure it is 'Comparable' before it is inserted into a structure that requires comparability. This prevents the ClassCastException/IllegalArgumentException sequence.

## Scientific Loop

- Turns: `1`
- Termination: `model concluded on its own`
- Loop duration: `4.252s`
- Probe misses: `0`

### Turn 1

**Hypothesis.** The Frequency class allows non-Comparable objects to be added to the internal TreeMap, which only fails when a second object is added and the TreeMap attempts to compare them. The fix requires validating that the input object implements Comparable before adding it to the collection.

**Prediction.** The addValue(Object) method currently lacks a check for the Comparable interface, allowing invalid objects to enter the state. Adding a check for 'instanceof Comparable' will prevent the invalid state from being reached.

**Concluded**: `Checking`
