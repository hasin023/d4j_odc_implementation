## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Code`
- Confidence: `0.9`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The defect is a procedural error where the method failed to return the correct value for a specific token type (XML_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE). This is a classic Algorithm/Method defect because the logic for handling the attribute value was incomplete, failing to satisfy the method's return contract. It is not a Checking bug because no guard was missing, and not an Assignment/Initialization bug because the issue was the lack of a return statement in the control flow, not an incorrect value assignment.
