## Failure Summary
- `org.apache.commons.collections.TestCollectionUtils::testRemoveAll`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<1> but was:<2>

## Suspicious Frames
- `org.apache.commons.collections.TestCollectionUtils.testRemoveAll` at `TestCollectionUtils.java:1283`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The bug is a classic procedural error where the wrong method was called to perform a task. This falls under Algorithm/Method because the logic for 'removing all' was implemented using the logic for 'retaining all'. It is not a Checking issue (no missing guard), not an Assignment issue (no wrong value), and not a design-level capability issue (the capability existed, just implemented via the wrong procedure).

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Qualifier: `Incorrect`
- Age: `Base`
- Inferred Activity: `Unit Test`
- Inferred Triggers: `Test Variation`
- Inferred Impact: `Capability`
