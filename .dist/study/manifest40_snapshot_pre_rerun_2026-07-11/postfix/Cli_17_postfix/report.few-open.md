## Failure Summary
- `org.apache.commons.cli.PosixParserTest::testStopBursting`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Confirm  1 extra arg: 2

## Suspicious Frames
- `org.apache.commons.cli.PosixParserTest.testStopBursting` at `PosixParserTest.java:141`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Code`
- Confidence: `0.95`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The defect is a failure in the procedural logic of the parser. The algorithm for token bursting was incomplete because it failed to exit the loop when the 'stopAtNonOption' condition was met. This is a classic Algorithm/Method defect where the procedure itself (the token processing loop) was missing a necessary control flow step (the break).
