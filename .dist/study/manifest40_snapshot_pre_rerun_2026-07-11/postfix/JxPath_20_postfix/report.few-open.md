## Failure Summary
- `org.apache.commons.jxpath.ri.compiler.JXPath149Test::testComplexOperationWithVariables`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Evaluating <$a + $b <= $c> expected:<true> but was:<false>

## Suspicious Frames
- `org.apache.commons.jxpath.JXPathTestCase.assertXPathValue` at `JXPathTestCase.java:52`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The bug is a classic procedural error where the wrong arguments were passed to a helper method, and the helper method itself was not correctly implemented to handle the specific case of comparing a non-Iterator to an Iterator. This is a local computational logic error, not a design-level capability gap or a simple missing guard, making 'Algorithm/Method' the correct classification.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Qualifier: `Incorrect`
- Impact: `Capability`
