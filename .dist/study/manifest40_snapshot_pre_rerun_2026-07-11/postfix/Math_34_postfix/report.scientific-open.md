## Failure Summary
- `org.apache.commons.math3.genetics.ListPopulationTest::testIterator`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Expected exception: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException

## Suspicious Frames
- No suspicious stack frames were extracted.

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Function/Class/Object`
- Family: `Structural`
- Target: `Design/Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The bug is a classic encapsulation failure where a class exposes its internal mutable state through an iterator. This is a structural design flaw rather than a local algorithmic error or a simple initialization mistake. The fix involves changing the interface behavior to return an unmodifiable view, which is a design-level correction.
