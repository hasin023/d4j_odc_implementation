# Defects4J ODC Classification Report: Csv-13

- Version: `13b`
- Work directory: `C:\d4j_work\postfix\Csv_13b`
- Generated: `2026-07-08T16:50:03+00:00`

## Failure Summary
- `org.apache.commons.csv.CSVPrinterTest::testMySqlNullOutput`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<"NULL"	[NULL]
- `org.apache.commons.csv.CSVPrinterTest::testMySqlNullStringDefault`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<\N> but was:<null>

## Suspicious Frames
- `org.apache.commons.csv.CSVPrinterTest.testMySqlNullOutput` at `CSVPrinterTest.java:331`
- `org.apache.commons.csv.CSVPrinterTest.testMySqlNullStringDefault` at `CSVPrinterTest.java:319`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Code`
- Confidence: `0.9`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The fix involves modifying the procedural logic in CSVPrinter to handle null objects differently than non-null objects. This is a correction to the method's internal computational strategy for handling nulls, which fits the Algorithm/Method ODC type. It is not a missing guard (Checking) because the logic was present but incorrect, and it is not an Assignment/Initialization issue as it involves changing the control flow of the printing process.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Qualifier: `Incorrect`
- Age: `Base`
- Inferred Activity: `Unit Test`
- Inferred Triggers: `Test Variation`
- Inferred Impact: `Reliability`
