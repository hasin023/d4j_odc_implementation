## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Checking`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The bug is caused by an insufficient validation check. The code was checking if the range was empty based only on the end index, but it failed to account for cases where the end index is valid but smaller than the start index. The fix adds a missing condition to the existing if-statement to correctly identify an empty range, which is a classic 'Checking' defect.
