- Confidence: `0.9`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The bug is caused by an incorrect implementation of the logic that determines the range of data to copy. The method calculates indices based on time periods and then passes them to another createCopy method that enforces a strict 'start <= end' check. The logic fails to handle cases where the requested time range does not overlap with the existing data, resulting in an exception rather than an empty series. This is an algorithmic error in how the range is computed and validated before the copy operation.
