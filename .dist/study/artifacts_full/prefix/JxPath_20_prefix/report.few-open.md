## Failure Summary
- `org.apache.commons.jxpath.ri.compiler.JXPath149Test::testComplexOperationWithVariables`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Evaluating <$a + $b <= $c> expected:<true> but was:<false>

## Suspicious Frames
- `org.apache.commons.jxpath.JXPathTestCase.assertXPathValue` at `JXPathTestCase.java:52`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ✅ Pre-fix only
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Design/Code`
- Confidence: `0.8`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The bug is not a missing check (Checking), nor a simple initialization error (Assignment/Initialization). It is a failure in the computational logic of the relational operator when processing specific types of operands (variables/iterators), which falls squarely under Algorithm/Method.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Impact: `Capability`
