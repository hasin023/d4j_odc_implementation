## Failure Summary
- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ParserSequenceTest::testInitialized`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<2> but was:<3>

## Suspicious Frames
- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ParserSequenceTest.testInitialized` at `ParserSequenceTest.java:60`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ✅ Pre-fix only
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Code`
- Confidence: `0.9`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The defect is a procedural error in the sequence's iteration logic. It is not a missing guard (Checking), a wrong constant (Assignment), or a design-level capability gap (Function/Class/Object). It is a flaw in the algorithm used to transition between parsers in the sequence, making it an Algorithm/Method defect.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Qualifier: `Incorrect`
- Impact: `Capability`
