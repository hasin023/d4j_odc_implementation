## Failure Summary
- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ParserSequenceTest::testInitialized`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<2> but was:<3>

## Suspicious Frames
- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ParserSequenceTest.testInitialized` at `ParserSequenceTest.java:60`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ✅ Pre-fix only
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Design/Code`
- Confidence: `0.9`
- Needs Human Review: `True`

The defect is a procedural error in how the sequence handles the transition between delegate parsers. It is not a missing check (Checking) because the logic itself is flawed in its execution flow, nor is it an initialization error. It is a classic algorithmic flaw in the sequence traversal implementation.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Impact: `Capability`
