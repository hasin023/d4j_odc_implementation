## Failure Summary
- `org.apache.commons.jxpath.ri.compiler.JXPath149Test::testComplexOperationWithVariables`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Evaluating <$a + $b <= $c> expected:<true> but was:<false>

## Suspicious Frames
- `org.apache.commons.jxpath.JXPathTestCase.assertXPathValue` at `JXPathTestCase.java:52`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Code`
- Confidence: `0.9`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The defect is a procedural error in the implementation of the relational expression evaluation. The code was passing arguments in the wrong order to a helper method, which is a classic Algorithm/Method defect. It is not a Checking issue (no missing guard), not an Assignment issue (no wrong value), and not a design-level capability issue.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Qualifier: `Incorrect`
- Age: `Base`
- Inferred Activity: `Unit Test`
