- Target: `Design/Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The bug is a classic off-by-one error in an iterator-like structure (JsonParserSequence). The logic for advancing to the next parser was flawed because it assumed the next parser was always at the start of a stream, ignoring the possibility that it might already be positioned at a token. This is a procedural/algorithmic error in the implementation of the sequence traversal.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Impact: `Capability`
