# Defects4J ODC Classification Report: JacksonCore-16

- Version: `16b`

## Failure Summary
- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ParserSequenceTest::testInitialized`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<2> but was:<3>

## Suspicious Frames
- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ParserSequenceTest.testInitialized` at `ParserSequenceTest.java:60`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Design/Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The failure is a classic off-by-one error in a sequence iterator. The logic for advancing the iterator does not account for the state of the underlying parser, which is a procedural/algorithmic flaw in the implementation of the sequence traversal.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Impact: `Capability`
