## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Checking`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The bug is caused by a missing guard condition. The code was unconditionally throwing an exception when the next iteration's denominator overflowed, without checking if the current (already calculated) fraction was sufficient. Adding this check resolves the issue, making it a classic 'Checking' defect.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Qualifier: `Missing`
