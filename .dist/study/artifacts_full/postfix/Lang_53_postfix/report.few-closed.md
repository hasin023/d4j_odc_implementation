- Confidence: `0.9`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The defect is in the procedural logic of the rounding algorithm. The 'done' flag, which controls the flow of the rounding operations, was being set incorrectly within the conditional blocks, causing the algorithm to skip necessary steps. This is a classic procedural/algorithmic error rather than a missing guard (Checking) or a simple value assignment error.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
