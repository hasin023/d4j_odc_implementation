# Defects4J ODC Classification Report: Compress-33

- Version: `33b`
- Work directory: `C:\d4j_work\postfix\Compress_33b`
- Generated: `2026-07-10T18:59:47+00:00`

## Failure Summary
- `org.apache.commons.compress.compressors.DetectCompressorTestCase::testDetection`: org.apache.commons.compress.compressors.CompressorException: No Compressor found for the stream signature.

## Suspicious Frames
- `org.apache.commons.compress.compressors.CompressorStreamFactory.createCompressorInputStream` at `CompressorStreamFactory.java:255`
- `org.apache.commons.compress.compressors.DetectCompressorTestCase.getStreamFor` at `DetectCompressorTestCase.java:165`
- `org.apache.commons.compress.compressors.DetectCompressorTestCase.testDetection` at `DetectCompressorTestCase.java:108`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The bug is a missing algorithmic step in the stream detection process. The system was unable to identify a specific file format because the logic to recognize its signature was absent. Adding this detection logic is a procedural/algorithmic correction to the stream identification method, not a design-level capability gap (the system already handles deflate, just not with this specific header) or a simple value assignment.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Qualifier: `Missing`
- Impact: `Capability`
