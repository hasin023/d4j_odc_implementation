## Failure Summary
- `org.jfree.data.time.junit.TimeSeriesTests::testBug1832432`: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Requires start <= end.

## Suspicious Frames
- `org.jfree.data.time.TimeSeries.createCopy` at `TimeSeries.java:880`
- `org.jfree.data.time.TimeSeries.clone` at `TimeSeries.java:857`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Checking`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Design/Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The bug is caused by an incorrect assumption in the clone() method that the range [0, count-1] is always valid. When count is 0, the range is [0, -1], which violates the guard condition in createCopy. This is a classic 'Checking' defect where the validation logic (or the caller's assumption of valid input) fails to account for an empty state.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Impact: `Reliability`
