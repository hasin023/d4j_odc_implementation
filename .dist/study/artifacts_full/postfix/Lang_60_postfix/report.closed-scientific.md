- Version: `60b`
- Work directory: `C:\d4j_work\postfix\Lang_60b`
- Generated: `2026-07-06T13:13:41+00:00`

## Failure Summary
- `org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilderTest::testLang295`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: The contains(char) method is looking beyond the end of the string

## Suspicious Frames
- `org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilderTest.testLang295` at `StrBuilderTest.java:1748`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Design/Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The bug is an algorithmic error in the loop termination logic. The methods were iterating over the entire allocated buffer rather than the active data size. This is a procedural logic error within the methods themselves, fitting the Algorithm/Method definition perfectly. It is not a missing check (Checking) because the logic was present but incorrect, nor is it an initialization error (Assignment/Initialization) because the variables were initialized correctly, just used in the wrong loop condition.
