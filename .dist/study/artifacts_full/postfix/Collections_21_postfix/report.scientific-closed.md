## Failure Summary
- `org.apache.commons.collections4.list.SetUniqueListTest::testSubListIsUnmodifiable`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: subList should be unmodifiable

## Suspicious Frames
- `org.apache.commons.collections4.list.SetUniqueListTest.testSubListIsUnmodifiable` at `SetUniqueListTest.java:470`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Design/Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The defect is a failure to adhere to the expected behavior of the subList() method. By returning a mutable list, the class allows operations that corrupt the internal state of the SetUniqueList. The fix is to wrap the returned sublist in an unmodifiable decorator, which is a local procedural change to the method.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Impact: `Capability`
