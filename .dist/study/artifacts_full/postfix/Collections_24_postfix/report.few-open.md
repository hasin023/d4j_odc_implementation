- Confidence: `0.9`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The defect is a structural mismatch where a class failed to adhere to a required interface contract (Unmodifiable). This is a relationship issue between the class and the marker interface it is expected to implement. It is not an algorithm/method issue because the logic for unmodifiability was present, just not correctly identified by the type system. It is not a Function/Class/Object issue because the capability (unmodifiability) existed, but the structural association (the interface implementation) was missing.
