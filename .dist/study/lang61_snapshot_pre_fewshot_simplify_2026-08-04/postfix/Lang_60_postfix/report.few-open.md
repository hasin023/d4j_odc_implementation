## Failure Summary
- `org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilderTest::testLang295`: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: The contains(char) method is looking beyond the end of the string

## Suspicious Frames
- `org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilderTest.testLang295` at `StrBuilderTest.java:1748`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The bug is an algorithmic error where the iteration strategy for searching the string builder was incorrect. It was scanning the entire allocated buffer rather than the active portion of the string. This is a procedural logic error within the methods, fitting the Algorithm/Method category perfectly.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Qualifier: `Incorrect`
- Impact: `Capability`
