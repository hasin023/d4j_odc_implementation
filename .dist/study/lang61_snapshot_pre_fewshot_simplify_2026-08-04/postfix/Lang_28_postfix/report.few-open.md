## Failure Summary
- `org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.NumericEntityUnescaperTest::testSupplementaryUnescaping`: junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: Failed to unescape numeric entities supplementary characters expected:<[𐰢]> but was:<[ఢ]>

## Suspicious Frames
- `org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.NumericEntityUnescaperTest.testSupplementaryUnescaping` at `NumericEntityUnescaperTest.java:33`

## ODC Result
- **Evidence Mode**: ⚠️ Post-fix (with buggy->fixed diff)
- ODC Type: `Algorithm/Method`
- Family: `Control and Data Flow`
- Target: `Code`
- Confidence: `1.0`
- Needs Human Review: `False`

The defect is an algorithmic failure in the procedure that writes the unescaped character to the output. The original implementation assumed all characters fit into a single 16-bit char, which is incorrect for supplementary characters. The fix implements the correct logic to handle these characters by converting them to surrogate pairs, which is a procedural/algorithmic correction.

## ODC Attribute Mapping (Optional)
- Qualifier: `Incorrect`
